1. Check if you have firefox installed and if it is the same version as the geckodriver
2. Don't have any other firefox instances open because the program closses them on exit 
3. Make sure you have the "cursor" library installed 
4. The last digits in the div classes names in the bet scraping XPATH may vary
5. The "game" variable (json) refused to return the indices when called ('frames' and 'gameMetadata')
   for an unknown reason. But if the json is dumped before the line that causes the error, the preview
   of the json file seems to be in order. WTF

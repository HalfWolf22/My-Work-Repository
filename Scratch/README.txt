I am not usually object-oriented, so here I wanted to show my abilities with working with classes. I also
wanted to present some technical knowledge as well. 

I want to note that there is some room for improvement of the Neural Network (Batch Normalization, Optimizer,
LR scheduler, Early Stopping, etc.) but since it is already very much inferior to Tensorflow and Keras, I decided
to finish where I did.

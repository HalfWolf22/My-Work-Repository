MOTIVATION

    Here are some things I want to point out before you go through my little project (or during). All credits go to
gov.data.rs where I downloaded all open-source data. That is where my troubles began. The data was not
user friendly for English-speaking users so I had to translate it, it contained a lot of seemingly random ID columns 
from what I assume are some types of databases that use those IDs for referring and some other minor things that I
also had to deal with.

    Not that all the datasets from the website were able to be used. I don't want to rant too much but here are some
noteworthy dataset bunches that weren't able to make the cut:
        - Construction Works, Business Services, Inside Trade, Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing, Catering and 
        Tourism, Law, Culture, The Environment,...
Not that those areas are not mentioned at all, on the contrary, they were widely used in my analysis through 
agregate datasets, but couldn't get treatment of their own. They were either redundant, unretrievable or not
usable.

    Also, I want to excuse myself if the EDA gets monotone while reading it, keeping it non-monotone was quite a 
challenge and in the end, I think I wasn't completely successful in achieving that.

COUNTRY CODES USED IN A PART OF THE NOTEBOOK

    "Alpha-2 code" was used, here is a website with the list of all the codes: https://www.iban.com/country-codes

NOTES

    - I am still in the process of learning, so my EDA might not be at it's full potential
    - "Activity" and "Sector" terms are used almost interchangeably
    - Normally, a country's population would be one of the first things I'd mention in a notebook like this one,
    but I thought that the results we got in the population (decreasing) are the product of the bad economic state 
    that we had to analyze all earlier in order to explain the decrease in population.

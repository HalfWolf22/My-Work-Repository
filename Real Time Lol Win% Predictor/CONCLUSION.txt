Even though some would say that this game is one-sided and that the Blue team didn't have a chance of winning and thus the
predictive power of the algorithm is not so significant. That is just not the case. This game gives us a clear look at some
"whys" in the model that we were unable to explain. It seems that the model successfully interprets the early game gold
advantage as a team that has a better micro-level play that is the mechanically better team, and on the other side
there is the macro aspect in terms of objectives, towers especially. That might also be the reason why the Random Forest
thought that Dragon Kills were unimportant while the "Who first killed the Dragon" feature is. Those subtle indications
could suggest that a Neural Network could give even better results than XGBoost by exploiting those insights on a
multi-level scale.

Riot Games and League of Legends don't provide the live stats somebody would need to use this algorithm to prevent
cheating (there is a 3 seconds delay) but it could be used on the professional level where the games are in fact, live.

# My-Work-Repository

This repository is mostly going to be used for personal projects which I want to share with the community and companies. It's open-source I guess, I at least want it to be. I am not specialized in Law, but some guys advised me to put the BSD license so it is easy for you guys to access and use my code.

EDS - Easy Data Science is so far my personal favorite, it should be updated as regularly as I can, but frequent is relative because it is modified daily. It will include the date though so no worries. For the other projects, which will all have it's own EDS patch, that EDS will be updated with the project update so EDS can vary from folder to folder. That is why the main one should be usually referred to.
